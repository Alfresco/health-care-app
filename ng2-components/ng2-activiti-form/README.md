# Alfresco Bpm Form component for Angular 2

## Prerequisites

Before you start using this development framework, make sure you have installed all required software and done all the 
necessary configuration, see this [page](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md).

## Install

```sh
npm install --save ng2-activiti-form
```

### Dependencies

You must separately install the following libraries for your application:
 
- [ng2-translate](https://github.com/ocombe/ng2-translate)
- [ng2-alfresco-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-alfresco-core)

```sh
npm install --save ng2-translate ng2-alfresco-core
```

#### Material Design Lite

The style of this component is based on [material design](https://getmdl.io/), so if you want to visualize it correctly you have to add the material
design dependency to your project:

```sh
npm install --save material-design-icons material-design-lite
```

Also make sure you include these dependencies in your `index.html` file:

```html
<!-- Google Material Design Lite -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/material-design-lite/material.min.css">
<script src="node_modules/material-design-lite/material.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/material-design-icons/iconfont/material-icons.css">
```

## Basic usage example

```html
<activiti-form [taskId]="selectedTask?.id"></activiti-form>
```

## Build from sources

Alternatively you can build component from sources with the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

### Build the files and keep watching for changes

```sh
$ npm run build:w
```
    
### Running unit tests

```sh
npm test
```

### Running unit tests in browser

```sh
npm test-browser
```

This task rebuilds all the code, runs tslint, license checks and other quality check tools 
before performing unit testing. 

### Code coverage

```sh
npm run coverage
```
