## Running a demo project

The Alfresco application development framework comes with a demo project that you can run to get a
feel for what's available.

Start by navigating into the app development framework source folder, and then the script folder:

```ssh
 cd alfresco-ng2-components
 cd scripts
```

Start using published components
---

This is recommended if you are running from the `master` branch.

Start the demo-shell app after installing all the dependencies from npm (*Note. do it this way only the first time, and be aware, it will take some time*)

```sh
./start.sh -install
```

Or, if you have previously run `-install` but want to update the dependencies, use `-update`

```sh
./start.sh -update
```

If there are no big changes in the demo-shell since you last started then you can start without `-install` and `-update` to skip fetching packages, which should be much quicker

```sh
./start.sh
```

If you get errors when starting which do not go away with `-update` or `-install,` or if you want to test starting the demo shell from a clean environment, then use the `-cleanInstall` option

This will remove previous versions of all packages, before running `npm install` again

```sh
./start.sh -cleanInstall
```

Start using linked components
---

This is recommended if you are using the `development` branch or a feature branch off `development`

If you want to use your local components use the following script with any of the previous options. It will npm link all the components
in the demo shell before starting up the demo-shell.

For a new environment, use `-install`

```sh
./start-linked.sh -install
```

When you are restarting, you can skip `-install`

```sh
./start-linked.sh
```

The parameters `-update` and `-cleanInstall` work as described above for `start.sh`

For development environment configuration please refer to [project docs](demo-shell-ng2/README.md).
